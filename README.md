Hey, I'm Callum! I'm currently working as a full-stack engineer, focusing on geospatial mapping development.
My personal projects span a number of interests, including:

- Audio and digital signal processing programming.
- Building fast and responsive frontends in React.js.

Other interests include:

- Working with atomic & immutable systems built on cloud-native technology.
- Developing my home server setup using Docker and other distributed technologies.
